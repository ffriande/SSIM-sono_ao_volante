## Abstract 

Road collisions lead to over 1.2 million deaths per
year and an even higher number of non-fatal, grave injuries.
Sleepiness represents 20% of these accidents globally, making
this one of the major causes of road deaths. The most susceptible
drivers to this problem are professional drivers who spend many
hours driving and tend to accumulate more sleep debt. So it
is important to have a method that predicts when drowsiness
situations will occur. Most of the available approaches focus
on detecting drowsiness while driving. So it is important to
develop a method to detect the preliminary stages of sleep
when they start occurring and also to predict them because
it can be too late to prevent an accident when the detection
tools detect the driver’s immediate drowsiness state. In this
paper, we describe a machine learning model that has been
previously developed and try to improve the results obtained. In
order to do that, we tested Recurrent Neural Networks and two
different classifiers, XGBoost and LightGBM. We implemented
hyperparameter tuning in all classifiers used. The results of
previously used classifiers increased in all cases. LightGBM
and XGBoost showed good results and proven that they can
also be used. Neural Networks did not show high results, but
this needs further investigation because we addressed simple
implementations, and the dataset is limited. This work can be
valuable for multiple applications, connected with detecting sleep
disorders and integrated into sleep detection and prediction while
driving, as well as predicting sleep stages for later detection of
sleep diseases.
